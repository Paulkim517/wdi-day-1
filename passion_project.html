	<h1>My Passion Project</h1>
		<article>My passion project is going to be a continuation of my project from my FEWD class that I took in LA. The name of the project is "Route Setters". My project is a solution to a problem that rock climbing gyms everywhere suffer from, poor rock climbing routes. The hope is that my website will connect climbing gyms to route setters and vice versa. It will be the Linkedin of the rock climbing world.</article>
